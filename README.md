# Lecture 1: Lab Introduction & Memory Mapped Hardware 
In this lecture, we will look at Lab 1, and we will also investigate the hardware/software boundary.

# Lab Admin
Firstly let's go through some Admin for the labs.

### Lab Groups 
For the labs, you will need to arrange yourselves into groups of two or three. Once you have decided on the members of your group __one lab member__ should input the student IDs of each group member into the form found here [[form link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=LrXKu76f1kOi859mxD3yaGURemXIkvJEi0OJyB0IdsxUNDNPUVFHWFdZSVFQMUhTTTNTRDRBSjBRNi4u)] by __Wednesday 03/02/2021__ before __15:00__ . After this time, any people left over will be randomly allocated into groups.

### Lab machine access
The EmSys labs will be using the Linux machines located in the Foundry. You should have received an email containing your login details to access these machines. __If you have not received your login details, please contact me__.

### Connecting to the Lab and Enviroment Setup 
Follow the guide [[here](https://github.com/STFleming/EmSys_labSetup)] on how to connect to the lab via ssh and setup your environment. 

### Lab1 repository
The Lab1 repository is available [[here](https://github.com/STFleming/EmSys_Lab1)]. Here you will find information on the lab tasks, the required structure of your logbook repository, and videos explaining how to use the tools.

### During the labs
The EmSys labs will use Discord to manage communications between groups and demonstrators. On Discord, there will be a voice channel will for each group. Each group member connects to their appropriate channel where they will be able to share their screens and complete the lab together. If you have a question, request assistance in the ``raise-your-hand`` channel, stating what room you are in; a demonstrator will come and join your voice channel and help you once they are free. Remember:  keep an eye on the ``lab-announcements`` channel for lab wide announcements.
